# Fourier_Drawing
Drawing a given path using epicycles (inspired from 3b1b). Animations created in p5 python.

The data points are obtained using a software GetData Graph Digitizer, which can be downloaded here:
http://getdata-graph-digitizer.com/download.php.

Paste the path in data file. May have to adjust the scale and and the number of terms in the py file to get a good drawing out!!
